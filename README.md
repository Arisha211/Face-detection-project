# Face-detection-project
In this project, I covered and studied in detail about face detection technique using haar cascades classifier and OpenCV to get the desired output.  Using OpenCV library, haar cascade classifier was able to perform successful face detection with high accuracy and efficiency. I also used the OpenCV package to extract some of the features of the face to compare them.
